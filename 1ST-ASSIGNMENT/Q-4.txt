 Question 4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
 'let' keyword?
-> We use variables to store the data and manage the data. 
let name = sujoy 
name = Rohit
console.log(name) // Rohit
 using let we reassign the value in variables. Let has personal block scope so it exicute inside let block scope
