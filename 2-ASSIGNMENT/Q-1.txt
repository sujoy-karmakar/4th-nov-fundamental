// Q1. Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programmig?

Operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on operands. There are many types of operators in JavaScript. For example, arithmetic operators handle mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Assignment operators are used for assignment operations, such as let x = 10, where = is the assignment operator. Logical operators, like && for AND, || for OR, and ! for NOT, are used for logical operations, such as let result = true && false;. Operators are indeed very essential in programming for data computation.
