Q-3 Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Unary Operators:
Unary Operator works on single Oprerands
let num = 5
unary +
console.log(+num);
unary minus
console.log(-num);
Increment
console.log(num++);
Decrement
console.log(num--);




Binary Operators:
Binary Operators work with two operators.
let a = 6
let b = 3
console.log(a+b)
console.log(a-b)
console.log(a*b)
console.log(a==b)

Ternary Operator




Ternary Operators:
It is the short hand of If elese conditional statement
let age = 20
let result = (age >= 18) ? "Allow" : "Not Allow"
console.log(result); //Allow
