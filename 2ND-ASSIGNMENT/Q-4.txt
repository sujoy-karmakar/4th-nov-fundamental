Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?

Precedence:- Precedence determines the priority of operators, meaning higher priority operators are executed before lower priority ones, following a sequence from high to low priority.
ex- let x = 5+2*5 //15 because this ex higher priority * then + 

Associativity:- Associativity defines the order of operations. If no specific order is set, operations are executed in a left-to-right sequence.
ex- let y = 10+5+3 //18 because this ex no specific order is set so it will exicute left to right.

That's the reason it is very important if we don't follow this, then our operation don't work properly.
